# Russia and Saudi Arabia Dataset Repository

This repository, similar to the `Global-PV-TE-Data repository`, provides solar photovoltaic-thermoelectric (PV-TE) system learning data specifically for Moscow, Russia and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The data covers a three-year period from 2019 to 2021, allowing for an in-depth analysis of PV-TE system performance in these two distinct locations.
